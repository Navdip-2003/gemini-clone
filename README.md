- **State Management**: Utilizes `useState` and `useContext` hooks for efficient state handling.
- **User Interface**: Designed to closely resemble the Gemini platform, providing a familiar and intuitive user experience.
- **Deployment**: Deployed on Netlify for easy access and seamless performance.
